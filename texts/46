noindent{The cognitive, behavioral, and emotional health of
a person is referred to as their mental health. In the present,
mental health has emerged as one of the most important yet
neglected facets of a person’s entire well-being. Though mental
health chatbots are up and coming, there is still a need for a cost-
effective, reliable, and interactive system. Stress and anxiety are
two of the few factors that damage mental health. A person with
mental health issues may suffer negative outcomes if sufficient
care is not provided. Nowadays, with advancements in technology,
one can use a computer to foretell the start of such mental
health issues. Despite the fact that numerous academics have
examined a range of methods for predicting depression, they
frequently depend solely on the use of facial expressions, which,
because they are subtle and small, can alter the performance of
the model. Therefore, using more elements like textual analysis
and emotion detection can help increase accuracy. In this study, a
method for predicting mental health status using facial expression
and sentiment analysis results is introduced. Through emotion
detection and text data characterising the user’s mood, the
suggested system replicates a one-on-one conversation between
the user and the chatbot. Emotional detection and textual analysis
are two features that can help predict mental health states more
accurately. The suggested chatbot uses cutting-edge technology
to analyse the user’s mood using a variety of inputs and offer
suggestions for managing the feeling.

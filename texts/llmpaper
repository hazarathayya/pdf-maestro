Abstract —
Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks and
beyond. This success of LLMs has led to a large influx of research
contributions in this direction. These works encompass diverse
topics such as architectural innovations, better training strategies,
context length improvements, fine-tuning, multi-modal LLMs,
robotics, datasets, benchmarking, efficiency, and more. With the
rapid development of techniques and regular breakthroughs in
LLM research, it has become considerably challenging to perceive
the bigger picture of the advances in this direction. Considering
the rapidly emerging plethora of literature on LLMs, it is
imperative that the research community is able to benefit from a
concise yet comprehensive overview of the recent developments
in this field. This article provides an overview of the existing
literature on a broad range of LLM-related concepts. Our self-
contained comprehensive overview of LLMs discusses relevant
background concepts along with covering the advanced topics
at the frontier of research in LLMs. This review article is
intended to not only provide a systematic survey but also a quick
comprehensive reference for the researchers and practitioners
to draw insights from extensive informative summaries of the
existing works to advance the LLM research.
